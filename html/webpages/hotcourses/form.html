	   <span id="content"> "The first day I came to ELS/Lubbock, I saw how a language institution like this would be a place where I could build my academic skills and be ready to start my academic life. ELS staff have been doing their best to come up with new strategies to help English learners to develop and enrich their English skills. My days there were an experience I will not forget." <strong>- Mohammed, Saudi Arabia</strong></span></p>

	   <span id="content"> "I was 17 years old when I arrived alone to Boston, and now I'm leaving with many friends around the world. I completed my English course successfully with the help of my excellent teachers, my kind classmates, and all the ELS staff who helped me improve my English every day. ELS not only taught me English, but also gave me the opportunity to join and enjoy the different activities and trips that they organized for us. I'm in love with this spectacular city. Boston is my second home and I'm never going to forget it. I really enjoyed every single day of this experience. Thank you to everyone who made it possible. <strong>- Valeria, Venezuela</strong></span></p>

	   <span id="content"> "My name is Manuela Santos and I am from Brazil. I decided to come to ELS Johnson City to improve my English skills, and I studied there for two months. I could not only learn English as a second language, but also I could learn academic skills that complimented my student journey and my future career." <strong>- Manuela, Brazil</strong></span></p>

	   <span id="content"> "My English has been more perfected than ever while I have been in ELS Language Centers at the University of Missouri, Saint Louis. Luckily, I took a placement test and I was placed in Master class. It took me just three months to train my skills. In my opinion, ELS is a very good place to have a good preparation before going to university or working. I was constantly trying to improve my writing but now I am very self-confident that I have mastered the tags at a variety of types of essays after several Advanced Reading and Writing classes. I can now speak more naturally, and above all, I can understand what native speakers are saying. Therefore, I appreciate my time at ELS. Fortunately, I was accepted by two of the most known Universities in Missouri, Webster University and University of Missouri, Saint Louis. <strong>- Quang Son,Vietnam</strong></span></p>

	   <span id="content"> "ELS helped me prepare especially with the writing classes, because some Louisiana Tech classes require essays and I have to finish the essay. I don't know how I would have been able to practice this in Korea. Also speaking, there's usually Americans that come to ELS and they can help ELS students to speak more in English." <strong>- Sangu Ko, Korea</strong></span></p>
