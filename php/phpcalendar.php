<!--
Everyone need to make a plan and execute it. If we say, we have to do it and show it.
We should let people know our capabilities. We should market ourselves what we have done because a product's success not only depends on its quality but also on Advertisements and Marketing.
We should update about out work to managers and clients regularly. Because if we do fantastic job and it is not updated then it is worthless.
We should make customers feel comfortable working with us. We should talk to them in the way they understands and should satisfy them.
Programmers should have good writing skills, because most of the communication in workplace happens through mail.
Face-to-Face communication with clients will be more effective than communicating via phone or email.-->
